The XFST script files in this folder model phonological metathesis
with different constraint rankings.

They can be run from within the XFST program, which can be downloaded
for a single machine, for non-commercial use, at 
http://www.stanford.edu/~laurik/.book2software/ .

To run the scripts, start XFST.  At the XFST prompt, type

source SCRIPTFILE

, replacing SCRIPTFILE with the name of the script you want to run.

The scripts include several sample inputs and will automatically show
them - and their corresponding outputs - after the FST has been built.
If you wish to run additional inputs, you can do so with the command

down INPUT

, replacing INPUT with the actual input you wish to test.
